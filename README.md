Automated Theorem Prover for Classical and Non-Classical Logics

Note: _This project was intended to be used in an artificial general intelligence system, but given that I've quite changed my mind on how to implement such a system, this repository is no longer being worked on and remains largely unfinished (even though the individual logics which are checked are completely functional and autonomous)._

Automated Theorem Prover based on Analytic Tableaux for:
- classical propositonal logic, :white_check_mark:
- classical logic with quantification, :white_check_mark:
- normal modal logic, :white_check_mark:

- conditional logic, :white_large_square:
- intuitionistic logic,  :white_large_square:
- many-valued logic, :white_large_square:
- relevant logic, :white_large_square:
- fuzzy logic :white_large_square:
